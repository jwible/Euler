"""Question:
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
"""

"""
Applied a mathmatical principle that every multiplication, of (N(1) digits) * (N(2) digits) either equals N(1)+N(2) or N(1)+N(2)+1
i.e. 10*10 = 100, while 99*99=9801
So to get a "pandigitial"
there are only two possibilities
N1*N4=N4 or N2*N3=N4
[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i]
a*bcde=fghi
ab*cde=fghi
note: while N4*N1 could also =N4 given we're looking for unique products all permutations would catch both
